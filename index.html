                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Hello and Assalam Alaikum visitor! Welcome to my page. I'm Shamyl and I'm a former teacher, technologist, product designer, entrepreneur,
                    and a maker. I love to solve problems and design new products, anything from SAAS based, to IoT
                    to Robots, I've worked on all of them. This page showcases the work I've done over the years. 
                    If you're interested in talking to me send me an email or a message on any of my Social Media channels.

                <h1>Over the Years</h1>
                <p>I started my career as a software developer back in 2005. During my short career as a developer I worked on embedded systems and UAVs.
                    It was a short stint of around 1.5 years, but it allowed me to learn a lot of the product development lifecycle. I went to Seoul (South Korea)
                    in 2006 and spent 2 years at Seoul National University getting my MS. This was also a wonderful period of a lot of learning and making
                    new friends from all over the world. After I came back I joined <a href="http://seecsnust.seecs.edu.pk/faculty/shamyl.html"> NUST</a> in 2009 as a lecturer. There I founded a research lab called SMART
                    (Smart Machines And Robotics Technology) Lab. Yes this was a recursive acronym! In the lab I worked on a number of different projects and
                    technologies. These included <a href="https://ignite.org.pk/development-of-a-tele-surgical-training-robot-and-simulator/"> Surgical Simulators</a>, 
                    Robotics, Embedded systems, Virtual Reality, Physical Interfaces for Computing and some Machine learning as well.
                    While at NUST I co-founded an EdTech company LearnOBots in 2014. In 2018 I completely left teaching and went full time at LearnOBots. Since then
                    I've been at LearnOBots creating products and services used by thousands of users (Children) wordlwide.
